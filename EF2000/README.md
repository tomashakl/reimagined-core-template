# EF2000 â€” Style Demo (Retro 90s Metallic)

This is a **visual prototype** of EF2000 using the **locked TFX core proportions 1:1**.
Images are **placeholders** (SVG data URIs) so you can preview color/font choices.

- Keep `../core-locked/` untouched.
- Replace placeholders by dropping your images into `/assets` and updating `index.html` paths.
